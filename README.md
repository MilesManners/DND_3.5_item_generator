# DND_3.5_item_generator
An item generator for enchanted items in DnD 3.5 ed.
In the broadest terms I need a comprehensive loot generator, in that I can input a gold value, apply a set of filters - 
including what sources I would draw from, the maximum or minimum individual value of any given item added to the list, allowed item types - then I'd press a button and it would output a list of items. The output would include the name of each item, the gold cost of said item, the source it was from, and the type of item it is.
It would need to be able to generate random weaponry too, including enchantments, material, and other miscellaneous modifiers
It would also need to be able to generate wands/scrolls/and potions for any given spell.
I can definitely put the time in to getting you a readied list of wondrous items, weapon and armor materials, weapon and armor enchantments, and spells for wands/scrolls/potions, if you can tell me what formats you would need for the list
I want to generate a list that is a mix of new items and pre built items to match a total gold cost
And being able to filter out specific item types that I wouldn't want to have added to the list
So say I put in 4100gp, and I don't want potions, scrolls, wands, or weapons. I could filter those out and hit generate.
Then it would generate a random list that would look something like this:
Bracelet of Braceleting | Wondrous Item | Wrist | Book of Booking P125 | 1100GP
+1 Armor of Acid Resistance | Armor | Random | Book of the Liar P12 | 2000GP
Dragonslayer Shield | Shield | Specific | Dragon's Tome P69 | 1000GP
Any of those fields should be filterable, so I could set a GP limit of how much any individual item on the list could be worth
Or I could restrict what books would be available
Or what item type or subtype could be apart of the list
